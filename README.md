# CaImAn 
<img src="docs/LOGOS/Caiman_logo_FI.png" width="400" align="right">

A Python toolbox for large-scale **Ca**lcium **Im**aging **An**alysis.    

CaImAn implements a set of essential methods required to analyze calcium and voltage imaging data. It provides fast and scalable algorithms for motion correction, source extraction, spike deconvolution, and registering neurons across multiple sessions. It is suitable for both two-photon and one-photon fluorescence microscopy data, and can be run in both offline and online modes. Documentation is [here](https://caiman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

# Quick start :rocket:
To get started quickly, from installation to working through a demo notebook, take the following steps. If you do not already have the conda package manager installed, [you can find it here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### Step 1: Install caiman
The following is all done in your anaconda prompt, starting in your base environment:
  
    conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba   # install mamba in base environment
    mamba create -n caiman -c conda-forge caiman # install caiman
    conda activate caiman  # activate virtual environment

### Step 2: Download code samples and data sets
Create a working directory with code samples and related data in a folder called `caiman_data`. Run the following command from the caiman virtual environment created in the previous step:  

    caimanmanager install

### Step 3: Try out a demo notebook
Step 2 created a `caiman_data` folder in your home directory. Here, we `cd` to its demo notebooks folder, and open a Jupyter notebook:

    cd <your home>/caiman_data/demos/notebooks  
    jupyter notebook 

Jupyter will open. Click on `demo_pipeline.ipynb` to get started with a demo! 

> Note that what counts as `<your home>` in the first command depends on your OS/computer. Be sure to fill in your actual home directory. On Linux/Mac it is `~` while on Windows it will be something like `C:\Users\your_user_name\` 

## For installation help
Caiman should install easily on Linux, Mac, and Windows. If you run into problems, we have a dedicated [installation page](./docs/source/Installation.rst): the details there should help you troubleshoot. If you don't find what you need there, *please* send us a [message on Gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#agiovann_Constrained_NMF:gitter.im), and we will help you get it sorted out. 

# Demo notebooks :page_with_curl:
Caiman provides demo notebooks to present each of our main pipelines, from motion correction to online CNMF. Once you've gotten things set up, the best way to get started is with the demo notebook that most closely matches your use case; you can adapt it for your particular needs. The notebooks covering the CNMF and CNMFE algorithms have the most details, covering many concepts used in the other notebooks.

The main use cases and notebooks are listed in the following table:
